## Password Game: A Modern Take on a Classic 🔑

**Embark on a journey to redefine the Password game experience with this evolving project, blending the nostalgia of the classic game with cutting-edge technology.**

This project is currently in its early stages, laying the foundation for a captivating online multiplayer Password game. The vision is to create a platform where players can challenge friends, compete against AI opponents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), and experience dynamic password generation for endless replayability.

### ✨ Future Features (Under Development)

*   **Sleek Web Interface:** Built with ASP.NET for the backend and React for a dynamic and responsive frontend. 
*   **Online Multiplayer:** Connect and compete with friends and players around the world.
*   **AI-Powered Opponents:** Challenge yourself against various AI models with different difficulty levels and playing styles.
*   **LLM-Based Password Generation:** Experience the thrill of unique and unpredictable passwords generated by advanced language models.
*   **GoblinLife Integration:** The game will be hosted on www.goblinlife.org, offering a seamless gaming experience.

### 🚧 Current State

The project has progressed beyond the initial phase. The core game logic and mechanics have been established using C#, providing a solid foundation. Additionally, new projects have been created for both the ASP.NET Web API backend and the React frontend, marking the beginning of the web interface development. 

The API project has undergone some initial customizations to tailor it to the specific needs of the Password game. 

### 🚀 Roadmap

1.  **Finalize Core Game Logic:** Thoroughly review and refine the C# backend to ensure robustness and address any remaining edge cases.
2.  **Develop Web API Endpoints:** Build out the necessary API endpoints to support game interactions, including player management, team creation, round handling, and password generation.
3.  **Implement React Frontend:** Design and develop the React frontend to provide a user-friendly and engaging interface for playing the game.
4.  **Integrate API and Frontend:** Connect the React frontend with the ASP.NET Web API to enable real-time communication and game interactions.
5.  **Introduce AI Opponents (Optional):** Explore the possibility of adding AI opponents with varying difficulty levels to enhance single-player gameplay.
6.  **Implement LLM Password Generation (Optional):** Investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate dynamic and creative passwords, adding an extra layer of challenge and engagement.
7.  **Deployment:**
    *   **Containerization:** Package the application components into Docker containers for portability and scalability.
    *   **Cloud Hosting:** Deploy the application to a cloud platform like Google Cloud Run for easy access and management.
    *   **Consider NGINX (Optional):** Evaluate the need for an NGINX server for advanced routing, load balancing, or API gateway functionality.
8.  **Launch on GoblinLife:** Once the game is fully developed and tested, host it on www.goblinlife.org to make it accessible to a wider audience.
